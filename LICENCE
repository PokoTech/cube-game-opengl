# LICENCE #

The code in this project is demonstration code.  It is my intention that the
code is in the public domain for whomever to use for whatever purpose.  This
means that I waive my moral rights and authors rights.

In some jurisdictions there is no concept of public domain.  Alternatively,
the above wording may not have the correct magical incantation to waive all
the rights I could claim over the code.  Should you wish, or need to, this
code is also licenced under the 2-clause BSD Licence.
